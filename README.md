The main goal for this practice is to deep dive in the use of graph database, specifically Neo4j. A Neo4j graph database stores data as nodes, relationships, and properties instead of in tables or documents. This means you can organize your data in a similar way as when sketching ideas on a whiteboard.

# Installation

Take into consideration the following installations:

1. Neo4j Desktop installed
2. Plugin "Graph Data Science Library plugin"
3. Database previously set (review the default DB is called "neo4j") -> If not, change the proper python files (where there is needed a session in neo4j)
4. The default port "bolt://localhost:7687" -> If not, change the proper python files (where there is needed a session in neo4j)
5. The default user "neo4j" and password "neo4j" -> If not, change the proper python files (where there is needed a session in neo4j)



# Implementation
For this solution, we will be using the Terminal.The first step is to create a virtual environment. For this, you should go to the Directory where your files are located.

Later, you need to create the virtual environment (if not created already):

>> python3 -m venv myenv
>> source myenv/bin/activate
>> pip install neo4j
>> python [file_name].py
